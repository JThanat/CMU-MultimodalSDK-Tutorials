    "We start off by (down)loading the datasets. In the SDK each dataset has three sets of content: `highlevel`, `raw` and `labels`. `highlevel` contains the extracted features for each modality (e.g OpenFace facial landmarks, openSMILE acoustic features) while `raw` contains the raw transctripts, phonemes. `labels` are self-explanatory. Note that some datasets have more than just one set of annotations so `labels` could also give you multiple files.\n",

    "Currently there's a caveat that the SDK will not automatically detect if you have downloaded the data already. In event of that it will throw a `RuntimeError`. We work around that by `try/except`. This is not ideal but it will work for now."

    "To work with multimodal time series that contains multiple views of data with different frequencies, we have to first align them to a ***pivot*** modality. The convention is to align to ***words***. Alignment groups feature vectors from other modalities into bins denoted by the timestamps of the pivot modality, and apply a certain processing function to each bin. We call this function ***collapse function***, because usually it is a pooling function that collapses multiple feature vectors from another modality into one single vector. This will give you sequences of same lengths in each modality (as the length of the pivot modality) for all videos.\n",

    "Here we define our collapse funtion as simple averaging. We feed the function to the SDK when we invoke `align` method. Note that the SDK always expect collapse functions with two arguments: `intervals` and `features`. Even if you don't use intervals (as is in the case below) you still need to define your function in the following way.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note: Currently the SDK applies the collapse function to all modalities including the pivot, and obviously text modality cannot be \"averaged\", causing some errors. My solution is to define the avg function such that it averages the features when it can, and return the content as is when it cannot average.***"
