# sdk-tutorial

This is a short tutorial for using the CMU-MultimodalSDK.

First of all you need to download the SDK from [here](https://github.com/A2Zadeh/CMU-MultimodalSDK).
Then you will need to set up some file paths in `./constants/paths.py`.

Then you are good to go, just run the `./tutorial_interactive.ipynb` and walk through its content!
